# PharmacyDeck — Summary

**By Pharmacy Time**

PharmacyDeck is an encyclopedia-style platform for pharmaceutical drugs. It is built as a **standalone application** (not only a website): a full-spectrum drug intelligence tool that combines regulatory, scientific, chemical, and editorial layers in one place.

- **What it is:** A reference and discovery tool for drugs: identity (RxNorm), chemistry (PubChem), FDA approval and labels, clinical studies (PubMed), and editorial coverage (e.g. Pharmacy Times). It supports **offline use** via downloadable SQLite “data packs” and a **cyberdeck-style terminal UI** with keyboard-first navigation and live molecule visualization.

- **Who it’s for:** Clinicians, researchers, students, and anyone who needs quick, structured, cited information on drugs—whether online or on a device without internet (e.g. tablet, Raspberry Pi, kiosk).

- **Standalone nature:** The core experience is designed to run as its own application (web app today; native/embedded later). It can sync with the cloud when online and run fully from a local SQLite pack when offline, so it is not tied to a single website deployment.
